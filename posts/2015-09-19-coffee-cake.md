# Simple Coffee Cake

(Originally posted on September 19, 2015)

This is my tried and trusted recipe for coffee cake. Not only is it simple and easy to follow, the ingredients are also pantry staples and there's nothing I would regret buying because most of these are also usable for other recipes.

## Ingredients
### Batter
* 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 6 tablespoons white sugar
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/3 cup shortening
* 3/4 cup milk (*modified from original 1/2 cup based on comments*) 
* 2 eggs (*modified from original 1 egg based on comments*)
* 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Topping
* 2 tablespoons butter, melted
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (*reduce by a couple pinches based on comments*)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

## Steps
1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch square pan.
2. In a large bowl mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Cut in the shortening with a pastry blender to the size of small peas.
3. In a separate small bowl, beat the egg well, then stir in the milk and vanilla. Add the egg-milk mixture to the flour mixture all at once. Stir carefully until just blended.
4. Pour batter into prepared pan and spread evenly. Drizzle top with melted butter.
5. In a small bowl mix together brown sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Sprinkle on top of cake. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.

## Notes
I need to figure out a way to make this vegan. In particular, need to find a good replacement for eggs. I still haven't found one that I like so far.
