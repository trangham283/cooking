# Banana Bread

This is my tried and trusted recipe for coffee cake. Not only is it simple and easy to follow, the ingredients are also pantry staples and there's nothing I would regret buying because most of these are also usable for other recipes.

## Notes
* I'm still not very happy with the texture of this cake. It was a bit too wet for my liking. 
* My baking powder must be too old for this to work well. The bread rose nicely but deflated as it cooled womp womp :cry:
