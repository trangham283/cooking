# 2-ingredient Chocolate Mousse

Original source: https://www.pickuplimes.com/single-post/2020/05/10/Tea-infused-Chocolate-Mousse

## Ingredients
* Aquafaba (chickpea water)
* Chocolate

... with the same volume ratio. For example, if you have 1 cup aquafaba, then get a cup of chocolate. 

## Steps
1. Whisk aquafaba until soft peaks form. I used a hand mixer. It's amazing how the liquid turns into soft peaky clouds!
2. Melt chocolate. Wait for it to cool then gently fold into the aquafaba mix.
3. Chill for at least 2 hours.

## Notes
Big fail on both times I tried this.
* First time: I made the crucial mistake of impatiently pouring chocolate in too soon. The warm chocolate killed all the airy fluff of my chickpea whisk. :sob:
* The most recent time: I waited a bit longer and thought the chocolate cooled down enough, but it still dissolved all the air fluff gahh. The taste this time was also worse, maybe because the aquafaba was 2-week-ish old :grimacing:? It ended up tasting quite salty. I think Goya aquafaba had salt in it? Do other brands have salt? 
* Gotta try this another time with stricter adherence to the recipe, such a simple and deceivingly easy recipe!
