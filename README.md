# cooking

I've been finding myself googling recipes I wanted to repeat over and over again. So I decided to start consolidating notes here, with my results and modifications. 

## General Notes:
* Seasonal food lookup: https://www.seasonalfoodguide.org/
* Solid is better measured in weight, maybe liquid as well? 
* Quick conversions: 1 tbsp = 3 tsp; 1 cup = 8 oz
* Invest in a good blender/food processor -- it's worth it.
* Pancakes are so easy and fun to make!
* Squashes taste like sweet potatoes.
